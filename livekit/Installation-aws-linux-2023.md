To install LiveKit on Amazon Linux 2023, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Update the System
Start by updating your system packages:

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```

### Step 2: Install Docker
Amazon Linux 2023 uses `dnf` as the package manager. Install Docker with the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install docker -y
```

### Step 3: Start Docker Service
Once Docker is installed, start and enable the Docker service to run on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Step 4: Add User to Docker Group
Add your user to the `docker` group to allow running Docker commands without `sudo`:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and back in to apply the group changes.

### Step 5: Install Docker Compose
Docker Compose is necessary to run LiveKit. Install Docker Compose by downloading it directly:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

It looks like the specific `docker-compose.yml` file for LiveKit might not be available at the URLs provided earlier. Here's how you can manually create a basic `docker-compose.yml` file for LiveKit:

### Step 1: Create a `docker-compose.yml` File

Manually create the `docker-compose.yml` file using a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

Then, paste the following content into the file:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  livekit-server:
    image: livekit/livekit-server:latest
    ports:
      - "7880:7880"  # HTTP port
      - "7881:7881"  # UDP port
    environment:
      - LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
      - LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
    command: --node-ip your_server_ip

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

### Step 2: Save and Exit

- To save the file in `nano`, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save.

### Step 3: Run Docker Compose

Now, run Docker Compose to start LiveKit:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

This should pull the necessary Docker images (LiveKit and Redis) and start the services.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

To ensure that everything is running correctly, check the running Docker containers:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

You should see the LiveKit server and Redis containers running.

### Step 5: Access LiveKit

You can now access LiveKit via your server's public IP address on port 7880:

```
http://your-server-ip:7880
```

Replace `your-server-ip` with the actual IP address of your server.

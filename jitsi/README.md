Jitsi is a collection of open-source projects that provide secure video conferencing and communication solutions. The primary components of Jitsi include:

1. **Jitsi Meet**: A video conferencing application that allows users to create and join video calls using a web browser or mobile app.
2. **Jitsi Videobridge**: A Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) that allows multiple participants to join a video conference by forwarding video streams between participants.
3. **Jicofo**: The Jitsi Conference Focus component that manages video conferences and participants.
4. **Jitsi SDKs**: Software Development Kits for integrating Jitsi functionalities into mobile and web applications.
